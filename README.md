# ResEmbed

A CMake/C++20 library for embedding binary files directly into your executables and libraries at compile time.

Resource files (images, text, shaders, etc.) are converted into C byte arrays during the build, then registered into a global, thread-safe registry accessible at runtime through a simple C++ API.

## Integration

```cmake
include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(ResEmbed
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/eyalamirmusic/ResEmbed
    GIT_TAG main)

FetchContent_MakeAvailable(ResEmbed)

add_executable(App Main.cpp)
res_embed_add(App DIRECTORY Resources)
```

## Basic Usage

### Embedding a single file

**CMakeLists.txt:**

```cmake
add_executable(MyProject Main.cpp)
res_embed_add(MyProject FILES "Resource.txt")
```

**Main.cpp:**

```cpp
#include <Resources.h>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << ResEmbed::get("Resource.txt").toString();
    return 0;
}
```

### Embedding a directory

**CMakeLists.txt:**

```cmake
add_executable(MyProject main.cpp)
res_embed_add(MyProject DIRECTORY Resources)
```

### Runtime resources with a shared library

A library can use `ResEmbed::get()` to access resources at runtime without embedding them itself. The application that links against it provides the actual resource files. This lets you reuse the same library with different resources per application.

**Lib.cpp** (the shared library):

```cpp
#include <ResEmbed/ResEmbed.h>
#include <iostream>

void printResources()
{
    if (auto res = ResEmbed::get("Text.txt"))
        std::cout << res.toString() << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "Missing Text.txt resource!";
}
```

**CMakeLists.txt:**

```cmake
#Lib only needs to link with ResEmbed
add_library(Lib STATIC Lib.cpp)
target_link_libraries(Lib PRIVATE ResEmbed)

# AppA embeds ResourcesA/Text.txt
add_executable(AppA Main.cpp)
res_embed_add(AppA DIRECTORY ResourcesA)
target_link_libraries(AppA PRIVATE Lib)

#AppB embeds ResourcesB/Text.txt
add_executable(AppB Main.cpp)
res_embed_add(AppB DIRECTORY ResourcesB)
target_link_libraries(AppB PRIVATE Lib)
```

Both apps share the same library code, but each provides its own `Text.txt`. The library checks for the resource with `operator bool` and handles the missing case gracefully.

All examples are available under `Examples/` in the repository.

## CMake API

```cmake
res_embed_add(<target>
    DIRECTORY <dir> | FILES <file1> [<file2> ...]
    [NAMESPACE <namespace>]
    [CATEGORY <category>]
)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter   | Required | Default       | Description                                           |
|-------------|----------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `DIRECTORY` | Either   | -             | Recursively embed all files from a directory.         |
| `FILES`     | Either   | -             | Embed specific files by path.                         |
| `NAMESPACE` | No       | `Resources`   | C++ namespace for the generated header.               |
| `CATEGORY`  | No       | `Resources`   | Category string used to group resources at runtime.   |

`DIRECTORY` and `FILES` are mutually exclusive. When using `DIRECTORY`, files are discovered with `GLOB_RECURSE` and `CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`, so adding or removing files will automatically trigger a CMake reconfigure.

You can call `res_embed_add` multiple times on the same target with different namespaces:

```cmake
res_embed_add(MyApp DIRECTORY shaders NAMESPACE Shaders CATEGORY "Shaders")
res_embed_add(MyApp DIRECTORY textures NAMESPACE Textures CATEGORY "Textures")
```

## C++ API

All runtime functions are in the `ResEmbed` namespace. The `<ResEmbed/ResEmbed.h>` header is linked automatically when using `res_embed_add`.

### `ResEmbed::get`

Retrieve a single resource by name (and optionally category):

```cpp
auto data = ResEmbed::get("image.png");
auto data = ResEmbed::get("image.png", "Textures");
```

### `ResEmbed::getCategory`

Retrieve all resources in a category:

```cpp
auto resources = ResEmbed::getCategory("Textures");

for (auto& [name, data] : resources)
    std::cout << name << ": " << data.size() << " bytes" << std::endl;
```

Each `res_embed_add` call generates a header named `<Namespace>.h` (e.g., `Resources.h`, `Shaders.h`). You must `#include` this header in at least one translation unit in your target to register the resources. If a generated header is not included, the corresponding resources will not be available at runtime.

### Alternatives
There are many existing similar solutions to this problem.
I will explore a couple that I know, and why I chose my implementation instead:

### #embed
C++26 brought in #embed that lets you embed resource quickly.
It's awesome, and you should be using it, but other than the demand for a very modern compiler
it's also a strict compile time API. 

One of my design goals was that you can create shared libraries that 'require' resources.
For example, you can now have a shared library that calls

```cpp
auto res = ResEmbed::Get("BackgroundImage.png");
```
And link multiple products against it, each with a different background image.

### JUCE's BinaryData
JUCE's BinaryData was a big influence on this design
Since it's something I use in production in audio software.

There are three main problems with the JUCE one:
1. It requires JUCE
2. It doesn't have a dyanamic runtime API, just a static one
3. It's using C++ instead of C for the resources, which makes it a bit slow

### vector-of-bool cmrc
https://github.com/vector-of-bool/cmrc

This library is quite awesome and uses CMake only and has a good runtime API, 
but it was just too slow to compile for my taste.
